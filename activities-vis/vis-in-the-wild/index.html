        <h2>What is the purpose of this visualization?</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this visualization is to highlight landmine clean up
          efforts in Vietnam. This is done by displaying how much area is
          contaminated and how much has been cleared. It also displays the
          amount of explosives handled. These cleanup efforts seem to be headed
          by the government and external organizations.

        <h2>What is the data? How was the data captured or collected?</h2>
        <p>
          Contaminated areas are found using technical surveys. Then further
          data is collected during mine removal work. When teams clear
          landmines, they record where it happened, how big the area was, and
          how many explosives they found. This information is saved in a
          database managed by Quang Tri province and then shown on the map.

        <h2>Who are the users this visualization was made for?</h2>
        <p>
          I feel that this visualization is made for everyone. Even as we
          discuss it right we have brought awareness to a topic that we probably
          didn't even know existed. This further increases the reach of the
          issue and hopefully earns the organization funds, especially that the
          visualization serves as direct proof of efforts. The visualization is
          even accompanied by educational material like different types of
          landmines.

          Questions + Insights: What can people ask and answer using this tool?
        </h2>
        <p>
          By looking at the map and the data shown, users can find answers by
          exploring different locations and seeing how many explosives were
          found and removed. This helps people understand where the biggest
          risks are and how much work has been done to make areas safe again.
          Donators may even be able to see how their money is being used.

        <p>
          This visualization is stunning and informative at the same time. It
          follows an amazing design scheme and has modern components without
          hurting the usability. The map is very interactive with filtering and
          a timeline feature. It also has all the other features that one
          expects from a interactive map.

        <p>
          I don't see any to be honest. Would love to hear your thoughts! If I
          was really pushing it I could say that animation restarting again
          after you select a region is a little annoying. It made me think there
          was no data for the area aty first.
